# Creative Image Processing with Pillow

This directory contains a script `pillow.py` that demonstrates the use of the `Pillow` library to apply creative effects to an image. The script converts an image to grayscale, applies a split-tone effect, and adds a textual watermark.

## Installation

1. **Python and pip**: Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If not, download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Pillow Library**: Install the `Pillow` library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
