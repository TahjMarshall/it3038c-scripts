To use this script:

Run the script in a Python environment where tkinter is installed.
A pop-up window will prompt you to enter the amount in USD.
Another pop-up will ask for your vacation spot.
The script will display the converted amount in the local currency of the chosen vacation spot and the best time to travel.
Finally, it will show the top 5 vacation spots with the best and worst purchasing power

I used Visual studio code with the python extension from Microsoft to run the script.
